                  As a junior developer at Oba Code, I actively contributed to the creation of various
                  types of websites. I was involved in developing these websites using technologies

                    appealing and user-friendly.

                  While working as an accountant at AHVIC, I handled financial matters,
                  ensuring all records were organized and accurate. This experience honed my

                   wasn't a challenge because my passion for coding made the journey smooth.
